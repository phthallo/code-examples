# code-examples

code examples from my top three areas - python, pygame and html/css.

pygame and python are primarily for school assignments whereas html/css are done for fun in my spare time. i've tried to pick the better examples, rather than the generic `print("hello world")` and `name = input("What's your name? ")`.

all code was written by me, annabel quach, sometime in the past two years.
