<!-- SIMPLE TO DO LIST CODE 
keep the credit edits are fine etc etc
(i should really write up a tos but i'm too lazy)

this is not interactable (for users visiting the page),
it can only be edited from the custom box however it should 
provide users with an idea of what your queue/to do list is like.

<!-- TO DO LIST STARTS HERE 
To "strike out" something on the to do list, you will need to do the following.
1. change "far fa-square" to "fa-check-square". this changes 
the icon to a checked square, rather than a normal square.
2. change "text-black" to "text-gray-400". this changes the 
font colour to be lighter.
3. place <s> and </s> around the text to be crossed out.
